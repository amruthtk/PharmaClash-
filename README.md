# PharmaClash-

PharmaClash is an advanced mobile health application designed to modernize how individuals manage

medication safety. By integrating Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, the system acts as a

personalized digital pharmacist. It automates the process of identifying medicines and verifying their

safety profiles, thereby ensuring that users can manage their health regimens effectively without needing

specialized medical knowledge. Furthermore, the system includes Voice-Guided Assistance, ensuring that

elderly users with poor vision can hear safety warnings instead of struggling to read them.

We are introducing this project to solve the critical problem of "medication clashes." In real-world

scenarios, patients often take multiple medicines simultaneously, not knowing that certain drugs can

dangerously react with one another or with their existing health conditions. Since most people cannot read

complex medical leaflets and manual typing is difficult for the elderly, there is an urgent need for a

system that automates detection. This project is implemented to prevent these errors using a "Scan &

Speak" approach, ensuring patient safety through technology.
